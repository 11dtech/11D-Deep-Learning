# gitTorch

This depository contains experimental deep neural network written in lua scripting language using Torch7 and public libraries. 

Details of Torch7 installation and tutorials can be found here: http://torch.ch/

Executing the .lua file(training the network) included in the depository requires iTorch extension(by Facebook) and Jupyter notebook. After launching iTorch using "itorch" command in the console, the lua script can be executed using "dofile($filePath)" command.
